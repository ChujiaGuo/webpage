          Hello, I&apos;m a computer science student with a passion for computer science and engineering. I enjoy working with others and exploring unique and innovative solutions to a variety of problems.
          In particular, I love tackling challenging problems and devising creative, practical solutions that make an impact. Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing badminton, reading, and playing any manner competitive games â€” but I&apos;m also amenable to just relaxing.
